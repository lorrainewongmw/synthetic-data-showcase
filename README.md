# Synthetic data showcase

> Generates synthetic data and user interfaces for privacy-preserving data sharing and analysis.

# Overview

In many cases, the best way to share sensitive datasets is not to share the actual sensitive datasets, but user interfaces to derived datasets that are inherently anonymous. Our name for such an interface is a _data showcase_. In this project, we provide an automated set of tools for generating the three elements of a _synthetic data showcase_:

1. _Synthetic data_ representing the overall structure and statistics of the input data, without describing actual identifiable individuals.
2. _Aggregate data_ reporting the number of individuals with different combinations of attributes, without disclosing small or precise counts.
3. _Data dashboards_ enabling exploratory visual analysis of both datasets, without the need for custom data science or interface development.

# Privacy guarantees

The main privacy control offered by the tools is based on the numbers of individuals described by different combinations of attributes. The `resolution` determines the minimum group size that will be (a) reported explicitly in the aggregate data and (b) represented implicitly by the records of the synthetic data. This makes it possible to offer privacy guarantees in clearly understandable terms, e.g.:

"All attribute combinations in this synthetic dataset describe groups of 10 or more individuals in the original sensitive dataset, therefore may never be used to infer the presence of individuals or groups smaller than 10."

Under such guarantees, it is impossible for attackers to infer the presence of groups whose size is below the `resolution`. For groups at or above this resolution, the 'safety in numbers' principle applies &ndash; the higher the limit, the harder it becomes to make inferences about the presence of known individuals.

This anonymization method can be viewed as enforcing [k-anonymity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-anonymity) across all columns of a sensitive dataset. While typical implementations of k-anonymity divide data columns into quasi-identifiers and sensitive attributes, only enforcing k-anonymity over quasi-identifiers leaves the remaining attributes open to linking attacks based on background knowledge. The data synthesis approach used to create a synthetic data showcase safeguards against such attacks while preserving the structure and statistics of the sensitive dataset.

# Quick setup

The easiest way to start is to [run the web application locally with docker](./packages/webapp/README.md#locally-run-the-web-application-with-docker). You will be able to experiment with your data and see in the result in real time using the UI.

If you are looking for faster alternatives to process bigger datasets, please refer to our [python pipeline tool](./packages/python-pipeline/README.md) or [CLI application tool](./packages/cli/README.md).

# All available tools

We provide a set of tools to synthesize, aggregate and evaluate your data, which can be used according to your use case/preference. The available tools are described below:

- **Python pipeline**: if you want to synthesize, aggregate your data and also generate the dashboards for visual analysis with a single command line command in python, please check the [python pipeline tool](./packages/python-pipeline/README.md).
- **Web application**: if you want to locally run a web application capable of synthesize, aggregate and evaluate your data directly on your browser using Javascript and Web Assembly, this is the tool for you. The data is processed locally and never leaves your machine. Please check the [web application tool](./packages/webapp/README.md).
- **Raw CLI application**: if you only want a command line interface (CLI) around our [core Rust library](./packages/core/README.md) for data synthesis and aggregation, please check the [CLI application tool](./packages/cli/README.md).
