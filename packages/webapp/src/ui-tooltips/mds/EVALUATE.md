This will run an analysis both on the sensitive data and the synthesized data, enabling a comparison between the two.

The **`analysis length`** determines the maximum length of attribute combination for which aggregate counts are precomputed and reported. In the **`navigate`** step, this value determines how many attribute value selections a user may make while retaining the ability to compare estimated (synthetic) vs actual (sensitive) values.

**Caution**: analysis results may contain metrics and information directly related to the sensitive data, and if shared, may violate the intended privacy guarantee.
