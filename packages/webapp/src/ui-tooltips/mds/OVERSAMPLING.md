**`Value Seeded`** synthesis proceeds by sampling attributes from single attribute counts. When the sampling is performed, there might be some attribute combinations that are oversampled (synthetic counts greater than reported aggregate counts).

This allows the oversampling to be `Unlimited` or `Controlled` with some parameters.
