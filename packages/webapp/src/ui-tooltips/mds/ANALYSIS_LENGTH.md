To complement the synthetic microdata, the tool also pre-computes reportable counts of sensitive records containing all short combinations of attributes. The privacy risk with such aggregate data is that small aggregate counts may identify specific groups of individuals, while precise counts may allow the detection of small differences over time. The pipeline thus protects the reported aggregate counts by rounding counts down to the closest multiple of the specified **`analysis length`**. The **`resolution`** specified in the synthesize step therefore acts as both the minimum threshold for reporting and the minimum difference between reported counts.
