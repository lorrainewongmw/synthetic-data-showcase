Choose how to split the privacy budget between the combination lengths

**`Prioritize Long Combinations`**:
Use this if you want to prioritize accurate counts for longer attribute combinations (for example, 3-counts being more accurate than 2-counts).

**`Prioritize Short Combinations`**:
Use this if you want to prioritize accurate for shorter attribute combinations (for example, 1-counts being more accurate than 2-counts).

**`Balanced`**:
Evenly split the privacy budget (epsilon) between 1-counts, 2-counts, and so on up to the aggregation limit.
