This page displays the comparison between the actual aggregate counts (rounded down to the nearest multiple of **`privacy resolution`** under k-anonymity, or otherwise protected with DP guarantees) and the estimated counts obtained from the generated synthetic data.

Queries for counts of records matching specific combinations can be created by selecting the corresponding bars and filtering the data accordingly. Customize the visible attributes by using **`Select Columns`**.
