### Mean value

Mean count of the `k`-length attribute combinations in the **sensitive data**.

For example:

```
A:a1 - 7
A:a2 - 3
B:b2 - 5
```

Mean of the 1-counts attribute combinations is `(10 + 5 + 5) / 3 = 5`

### Mean error

The **absolute difference between the aggregate or synthetic count and the sensitive count** (original value).
