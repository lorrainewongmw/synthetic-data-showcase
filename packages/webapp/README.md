# SDS web application

Web application that allows you to synthesize, aggregate and evaluate your data directly on your browser. This requires no server or backend APIs to process the data, the data processing happens directly in the browser using Javascript and Web Assembly. This means that the data is processed locally and never leaves your machine.

# How to run?

The web application runs based on Typescript and the Web Assembly bindings around the `core` library.

To run it we need to build the wasm bindings as well the web application. If you want to compile it yourself, please to the [advanced setup](#advanced-setup) session below.

However, to make the web application easier to run we provide a docker image that can be locally built, so you don't need to worry about the details of compiling the wasm bindings and also the web application.

## Locally run the web application with docker

> **New to docker?** Take a look at [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/) first.

To run the application locally with docker, please follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have docker up and running on your machine (more details on how to install it based on your operating system can be found in [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)).
2. Make also sure you have docker compose installed, this will allow us to run the application with a single command (more details on to install it can be found in [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/))
3. After docker is installed and running, as well as docker compose, browse to the root directory of the cloned repository and run: `docker-compose up --build` (press CTRL + C to stop it)

## Advanced setup

### I. Compile the wasm bindings

To compile the wasm bindings please follow the steps provided in [here](../lib-wasm/README.md#how-to-compile).

### II. Install Node tooling

The application relies on NodeJS and Yarn for development and building, so you will need Yarn (version 1.22.11) and Node (version 14.17.6).

### III. Install dependencies and start

Browse to the root of the cloned repository and run:

```bash
> yarn install
> yarn start:app
```

This will start the web application that should be accessible on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

> The website will start in development mode, which relies on browser native features currently supported only in Edge and Chrome. However, the docker imagine above is targeted for production and should support other browsers.

# Usage

The web application allows the user to experiment with their data and check the results in real time, without the need to run the command line application. It is currently divided into 4 steps.

## Prepare

Allow the user to load data (csv or tsv files), select the wanted columns, mark sensitive zero columns and perform binning.

## Synthesize

Allow the user to provide the wanted resolution and synthesize the data.

## Evaluate

Allow the user to compare the synthetic data to the sensitive data based on a reporting length, including metrics and charts about the data.

## Navigate

Allow the user to compare the synthetic data counts with the aggregated data counts.
